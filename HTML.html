        <h3>Understanding the Basics: What is HTML?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        Before I dive into the exciting world of HTML projects, I want to share why grasping the basics of HTML is crucial. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5847/a-marketer-s-guide-to-html5.aspx?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com%2Fwebsite%2Fhtml-projects-for-beginners&hubs_content-cta=HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational building block of the web. It’s not a programming language, but a markup language that I use to define the structure and layout of a web page through various elements and tags.
        <p>To me, HTML is like creating a framework for web content, similar to how an architect designs a building's blueprint. You would use tags to mark up text, insert images, create links, and lay out web pages in a format that browsers can understand and display. These <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/html-elements?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com%2Fwebsite%2Fhtml-projects-for-beginners&hubs_content-cta=tags" target="_blank">tags</a>, the basic units of HTML, help differentiate between headings, paragraphs, lists, and other content types, giving the web its versatile and user-friendly nature.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Every web developer starts somewhere, and for many, including myself, that starting point is HTML. It's a language that empowers me to create, experiment, and develop various <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/digital-customer-experience?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com%2Fwebsite%2Fhtml-projects-for-beginners&hubs_content-cta=digital%20experiences" target="_blank">digital experiences</a>. So, as we embark on these beginner projects, remember that you're not just learning a new skill. You are stepping into a world full of endless possibilities and opportunities.</p>
